This project is an attempt at a better desktop and mobile launch page.  It has keyboard shortcuts, nested folders, cool design and is easy to edit.

To add a link open template.html.  The main block of code should look like this:

          <a href="insert link" id="1" class="lBox">
								<div class="button">
									<img src="src/ba.png" style='max-width: 40px'>
								</div>
								<h3>Back</h3>
                <p>To the Future</p>
            </a>
            
h3 displays the website tittle, p the subtittle and "button" contains the image, just edit these and you have a functioning tile

To add a folder just copy the template.html file and rename it.  In the origional add a tile for your folder and in the new html file just change the url of back to "template.html" or the url of the source page.
